# Pepper sauce fulfillment

## Description

Juan Hernandez is a Shopify merchant that owns a Pepper sauce shop
with five locations: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary and Halifax.
He also sells online and ships his sauces across the country from one
of his brick-and-mortar locations.

The pepper sauces he sells are:

* JalapeÃ±o (J)
* Habanero (H)
* Serrano  (S)

The inventory count for each location looks like this:

| City       |  J   |  H   |  S   |
| ---------- | ---  | ---  | ---  |
| Toronto    |  5   |  0   |  0   |
| Vancouver  | 10   |  2   |  6   |
| Montreal   |  3   |  5   |  5   |
| Calgary    |  1   | 18   |  2   |
| Halifax    | 28   |  2   | 12   |

Every time he gets an online order, he needs to figure out
which locations can fulfill that order. Write a function that
takes an order as input and outputs a list of locations which
have all the items in stock.

### Example 1:

```
Input:  {"J": 3, "H": 2, "S": 4}
Output: ["Vancouver", "Montreal", "Halifax"]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:  {"H": 7, "S": 1}
Output: ["Calgary"]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input:  {"J": 1, "H": 1, "S": 1}
Output: ["Vancouver", "Montreal", "Calgary", "Halifax"]
```

### Example 4:

```
Input:  {"J": 4}
Output: ["Toronto", "Vancouver", "Halifax"]
```

### Example 5:

```
Input:  {"J": 6, "H": 10, "S": 8}
Output: []
```
